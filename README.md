# AuraLMS: A Comprehensive AI-Powered Learning Platform

## Overview

AuraLMS is an innovative learning management system designed to enhance both the teaching and learning experience. It integrates advanced AI capabilities to provide personalized feedback, interactive learning modules, and comprehensive platform management tools. 

This README outlines the core features, usage, and technologies powering the AuraLMS project.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Driven Mock Interviews:** Simulate professional job interview experiences with AI-generated questions and detailed feedback, adaptable to various job roles and experience levels.  
*   **Interactive Coding Modules:** Engage users with interactive coding exercises. Learn programming languages easily through option based prompts and immediate result feedback.
*   **Comprehensive LMS Management:** A complete suite to manage users, assignments, quizzes, and facilitate communication.
*   **AI-Enhanced Content Processing:** Utilizes AI to process learning materials, like PDFs, automatically generating useful components, notes, etc.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with clarity in mind, featuring an easily navigable dashboard, intuitive controls, and a night mode for optimized viewing.
*   **Messaging System:** Facilitate communication between students and teacher.

## Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js with MySQL database
*   **AI Integration:** [Specify libraries or services used, e.g., OpenAI, TensorFlow, custom AI models, etc.]

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_URL]
    cd AuraLMS
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *For Frontend*

    ```bash
    cd frontend  # or the relevant directory
    npm install or yarn install
    ```

    *For Backend*

    ```bash
    cd backend # or the relevant directory
    npm install or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Create environment configuration files (.env) in both frontend and backend directories. See `.env.example` for needed variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).
    *   Set up the database:

        *   Create a MySQL database named "auralms".
        *   Run the SQL migration scripts located in backend/migrations to create the required tables.

4.  **Running the Application:**

    *For Frontend*

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start or yarn start
    ```

    *For Backend*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start or yarn start
    ```

    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or at the specific port the React and Node.js apps are running on.

## Future Roadmap

*   Expand language offerings in interactive coding modules.
*   Enhance AI-driven learning paths for different skillsets.
*   Integration with video conferencing tools for live classes and interactive sessions.
*   Improved data analytics and reporting on student performance.
